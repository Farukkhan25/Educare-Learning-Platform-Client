Welcome to my new react app. This is an online course related website where you may find different courses to attend.

## Overview

In this project an user can enroll to various online courses, where they will find good contents with certifications. From 'courses nav' user will visit in different topics and choose them wisely. But first they have to register to enroll the course they choose. There are also a blog page and a FAQ page attached in this project.

### Features

In this project i used react-router-dom and react-bootstrap to design. I hope visiters will feel good and inspire me for my future work.

It is deployed in firebase. Firebase authentication systems were use for signin and registration.

I also used vercel for server data load.

The project is under construction. Many features will be added as it is just the beginning.
